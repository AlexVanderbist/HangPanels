Welcome to HangPanels's documentation!
======================================

HangPanels creates a :py:class:`pandas.Panel` from your Hangouts conversations to help you to analyze your own chats.
Please remember that **This is work in progress**. API design will change and it's not stable at any meaning.

You can install it using PyPI or conda, check :doc:`installation`

Suggestions and requests are very welcomed at gabriel.maeztu@gmail.com
